## SUMMARY:
 < Part A contains both methods of racing. The first method calculates a random number between 1 and 100 and immediately moves each turtle forward that number of spaces. The second method loops through 20 "laps" where a random number between 1 and 10 is calculated for each turtle and they are then moved their respective value, 20 times each which more accurately simulates a "real" race.
 
 For Part B, I created a function called drawShape where the input should be an integer containing the number of sides of the shape you would like to draw and then loops through moving Leonardo forward and turning them at the proper angle for the amount of sides in the shape with static side length and then clears the drawing when it is done. I then called this function five times, once for each different shape we were asked to draw.>

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 < Is there a better way to implement a function like I made for Part B? Do you usually create the function in the main like that or do you make a separate header file and import it in?  >
